1. Create a Proper Python Package Structure
This is the most logical next step. Instead of having all your .py files in the root directory, you can turn your application into an installable Python package.

What it looks like:

/your-project-root
├── my_app/
│   ├── __init__.py      # <-- app.py's content goes here (the create_app factory)
│   ├── routes.py
│   ├── models.py
│   ├── forms.py         # (Optional, for Flask-WTF forms)
│   ├── static/
│   └── templates/
├── config.py
└── run.py               # <-- A small script to run the app
Why it's better: It makes your application more modular, prevents circular imports more effectively, and is the standard way to structure larger Python projects.

2. Use Flask-WTF for Forms
Right now, you are manually handling form data with request.form. Using the Flask-WTF extension is a much cleaner, more secure, and more powerful way to manage forms.

What it involves:

Creating a forms.py file.

Defining form classes (e.g., LoginForm, ContactForm) with fields and validators.

Simplifying your routes, as the form object will handle data validation and CSRF protection for you.

Why it's better: It provides automatic CSRF protection, built-in validation (e.g., checking for valid email formats, password length), and makes rendering forms in your templates much easier.

3. Split Routes into Multiple Blueprints
Your routes.py file currently handles everything: general pages, authentication, and quotes. As your application grows, you can split these into separate blueprints for better organization.

What it looks like: You might have:

auth_routes.py: For /login, /signup, /logout.

quote_routes.py: For /quote, /quote/add.

main_routes.py: For /, /about, /contact.

Why it's better: It keeps related routes together and makes the codebase easier to navigate and maintain. Each major feature of your site can have its own blueprint.

4. Use Flask-Migrate for Database Migrations
You are currently using db.create_all(). This is great for starting, but it cannot handle changes to your models once you have data in your database (e.g., adding a new column to the User model).

What it involves: Adding the Flask-Migrate extension. It allows you to generate "migration scripts" that update your database schema without losing data.

Why it's better: It's essential for any application that will be deployed and maintained over time. It provides a safe and version-controlled way to evolve your database structure.
